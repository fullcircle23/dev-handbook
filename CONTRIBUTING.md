## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to **dev-handbook** ðŸ™Œ This repository is intended as a
practical knowledge base for developers. To keep it useful and consistent, please follow the
guidelines below.

---

## General Principles

- Keep contributions **concise** and **practical** (cheatsheets, quick guides, runnable examples).
- Use **Markdown** for documentation.
- Add new content under the correct topic folder (e.g., `git/`, `devops/`, `programming/`).
- For bigger additions or structural changes, please open an **issue** or start a **discussion**
  first.

---

## Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Examples:

```
feat(git): add example for cherry-pick
fix(docker): correct command for volume mount
docs(clean-code): expand section on naming conventions
```

---

## Markdown Style Rules

We use **markdownlint** in CI to enforce consistent style. Please follow these rules:

- **Single top-level heading per file** (`MD025`)
  - Use one `#` heading for the document title.
  - All other sections should use `##` or deeper.

- **Donâ€™t skip heading levels** (`MD001`)
  - Nest headings sequentially (e.g., `##` â†’ `###` â†’ `####`).

- **Use hash-style headings** (`MD003`)
  - Always use `#`, `##`, `###` for headings (avoid underlined `===` or `---`).

- **No trailing punctuation in headings** (`MD026`)
  - Avoid headings ending with `.`, `:`, `;`, `!`, `?`.

- **Long lines allowed** (`MD013` disabled)
  - No hard line-length limit; rely on Prettier for wrapping.

- **Code fences** (`MD040` disabled)
  - Specifying a language (` ```bash `) is optional but encouraged for clarity.

---

## Local Checks

Before committing, run:

```bash
make lint-md
```

This will:

1. Format Markdown with Prettier.
2. Auto-fix common markdownlint issues.
3. Report any remaining style errors.
4. CI will re-check everything on pull requests.

---

## Adding Code Examples

If you add runnable code:

- Place it under the appropriate language folder (e.g., programming/python/,
  programming/javascript/).
- Include a minimal test in tests/ or **tests**/.
- Ensure tests pass locally before committing (make test).

---

By following these guidelines, you help keep the dev-handbook clean, consistent, and useful for
everyone ðŸš€

Thanks for your contribution!
